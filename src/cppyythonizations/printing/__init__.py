Pythonizations to improve printing of types in cppyy.

EXAMPLES::

    >>> import cppyy
    >>> cppyy.cppdef("namespace demo { class X{}; }")
    True
    >>> cppyy.cppdef('std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const demo::X&) { return os << "X()"; }')
    True

    >>> from cppyythonizations.printing import enable_pretty_printing
    >>> cppyy.py.add_pythonization(enable_pretty_printing, "demo")
    >>> cppyy.gbl.demo.X()
    X()

TESTS:

Modifying `__str__` changes how an element displays::

    >>> cppyy.gbl.demo.X.__str__ = lambda self: "Y()"
    >>> cppyy.gbl.demo.X()
    Y()
